P-N junction is the basic component of semiconductor devices.
I'm not going to explain about what is P-type, N-type semiconductor is... to summarize P-type has more holes and N-type has more electrons.

##**1. "Drift" and "Diffusion"**

###1. Drift : The movement caused by electric field.
>Efecteted by the current flow. (It could be external current or depletion region current)
>> J<small>drift</small> =qnμE
###2. Diffusion : The flow caused by variation in the concentration.


Efecteted by the electric field. (It could be built-in electric field or external electric field)

**2. Biased P-N junction**
