Welcome! 

This blog is built using **Jekyll**, which means I can write all my posts in **Markdown**. GitHub Pages will automatically turn this file into a beautiful webpage.

### Why Jekyll?
1. **Fast**: It generates static HTML.
2. **Simple**: No databases required.
3. **Versatile**: It supports themes and custom layouts.

Stay tuned for more updates!
